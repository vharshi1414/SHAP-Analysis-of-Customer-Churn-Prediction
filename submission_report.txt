2) Global SHAP top features (by mean |SHAP|):
1. Contract_Month-to-month
2. tenure
3. MonthlyCharges

3) Global findings and actions:
Executive summary - top actionable recommendations based on SHAP analysis:
- Contract_Month-to-month: observed to be a top driver. Recommendation: monitor and modify policies related to Contract_Month-to-month (e.g., personalize pricing/plan, targeted outreach) to reduce churn risk.
- tenure: observed to be a top driver. Recommendation: monitor and modify policies related to tenure (e.g., personalize pricing/plan, targeted outreach) to reduce churn risk.
- MonthlyCharges: observed to be a top driver. Recommendation: monitor and modify policies related to MonthlyCharges (e.g., personalize pricing/plan, targeted outreach) to reduce churn risk.

Short local actions: for high-risk customers (highest predicted probability), run targeted retention campaigns addressing the top positive SHAP contributors (discounts, personalized offers, support calls).

4) Local captions for selected examples:

Example highest_prob (index 1090):
Example `highest_prob` (index 1090): model predicted churn probability = 0.925 (pred_label=1, true_label=1).
The SHAP force plot shows the top positive (red/right) & negative (blue/left) feature contributions pushing the prediction toward churn (positive) or retention (negative). Interpretation: features with large positive SHAP values are the primary drivers increasing the customer's churn risk; features with large negative SHAP values reduce churn likelihood.
Business implication: for this customer, target interventions should focus on reversing the largest positive contributors (e.g., reduce monthly charges, address service issues, or personalize offers) as identified in the plot.

Example lowest_prob (index 793):
Example `lowest_prob` (index 793): model predicted churn probability = 0.003 (pred_label=0, true_label=0).
The SHAP force plot shows the top positive (red/right) & negative (blue/left) feature contributions pushing the prediction toward churn (positive) or retention (negative). Interpretation: features with large positive SHAP values are the primary drivers increasing the customer's churn risk; features with large negative SHAP values reduce churn likelihood.
Business implication: for this customer, target interventions should focus on reversing the largest positive contributors (e.g., reduce monthly charges, address service issues, or personalize offers) as identified in the plot.

Example median_prob (index 1360):
Example `median_prob` (index 1360): model predicted churn probability = 0.173 (pred_label=0, true_label=0).
The SHAP force plot shows the top positive (red/right) & negative (blue/left) feature contributions pushing the prediction toward churn (positive) or retention (negative). Interpretation: features with large positive SHAP values are the primary drivers increasing the customer's churn risk; features with large negative SHAP values reduce churn likelihood.
Business implication: for this customer, target interventions should focus on reversing the largest positive contributors (e.g., reduce monthly charges, address service issues, or personalize offers) as identified in the plot.

Example false_negative (index 9):
Example `false_negative` (index 9): model predicted churn probability = 0.369 (pred_label=0, true_label=1).
The SHAP force plot shows the top positive (red/right) & negative (blue/left) feature contributions pushing the prediction toward churn (positive) or retention (negative). Interpretation: features with large positive SHAP values are the primary drivers increasing the customer's churn risk; features with large negative SHAP values reduce churn likelihood.
Business implication: for this customer, target interventions should focus on reversing the largest positive contributors (e.g., reduce monthly charges, address service issues, or personalize offers) as identified in the plot.

Example false_positive (index 1):
Example `false_positive` (index 1): model predicted churn probability = 0.814 (pred_label=1, true_label=0).
The SHAP force plot shows the top positive (red/right) & negative (blue/left) feature contributions pushing the prediction toward churn (positive) or retention (negative). Interpretation: features with large positive SHAP values are the primary drivers increasing the customer's churn risk; features with large negative SHAP values reduce churn likelihood.
Business implication: for this customer, target interventions should focus on reversing the largest positive contributors (e.g., reduce monthly charges, address service issues, or personalize offers) as identified in the plot.
